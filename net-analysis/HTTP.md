# HTTP Notes

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting data over the web. HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between clients and servers, as well as how servers should respond to these kinds of requests. When you put a URL into a browser, HTTP is what allows your browser to request a resource (website, image, etc) from the server and recieve that response. HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is seperate and does not remember info about previous requests unless additional mechanisms are used such as cookies.

## Why HTTP Is Important

HTTP is important because it
- allows communication between browsers and servers
- creates the foundation of the www (worldwide web)
- works across different platforms/devices
- allows standard communication via request and response
- helps secure communication when combined with any sort of encryption, which is HTTPS

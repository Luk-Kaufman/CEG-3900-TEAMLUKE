# Metadata Notes

Metadata: Provides additional information about a particular piece of data.
- This helps to organize, manage, and understand the information.
- In short, it's data about data.

## Why is metadata so important?

Metadata provides context, structure, and meaning to data.

Without it, data is often just a bunch of raw numbers, text, or files that are difficult to understand.

Metadata helps with:

- Organization; Metadata describes data in a way that makes things easier to find. (For example, metadata for a picture can include the exact time a photo was taken, where in the world it was taken, what exact device was used to take the picture, the exposure time, etc.)

- Data understanding; Metadata helps to explain what the data is and how it was collected and should be utilized. This helps avoid misinterpretation. This is especially helpful in research and science, as well as databases.

- Data Quality and Integrity; Metadata can include info about the source, accuracy, or version of data. This helps users figure out whether or not the source is reliable.

- Compliance and Security; Metadata tracks access, ownership, and permissions. All of this is important for privacy and/or legal requirements.

## Concepts about Metadata

### Metadata

This is the foundation. Metadata describes other data so users and systems can understand it.
Example:
A file named 
```
urface.jpg
```
that is data.

"Taken 02/14/2025, Apple, iPhone 16, Indiana" is metadata.

### Descriptive Metadata

This helps you find something and identify it, such as titles, author tags, or keywords. Think of this like a book title or a filename.

### Structural Metadata

This shows how pieces of data fit together. It gives this data organization and, as the name suggests, structure.

### Administrative Metadata

Helps manage data behind the scenes.

This is stuff such as:

- Creation date
- File type and size
- Permissions and ownership
- Version history.

This is what IT systems and databases rely on to keep things running well.

### Technical Metadata

Describes the technical details needed for users to be able to use the data.This would include thigns like video resolution, video length, or document encoding.

### Provenance

Tracks data origin and what happened to it.

This is very important in areas such as science, research, AI, and finance because people need to know:

- Who made it
- When it was changed
- What processes changed it

### Standards and Schemas

Metadata works best when it follows a certain structure.

Think of the EXIF for photos or Schema.org for websites.

### Interoperability

Metadata allows seperate systems to communicate with one another.

A hospital system and pharmacy software can all exchange patient info correctly because the metadata defines what each data field means.

### Discoverability

Good metadata makes data findable.

Things such as search engines and music apps all rely on metadata so users can search instead of manually scrolling through the files.

### Goverance and Compliance

Metadata supportes rules, privacy, and accountability.

This can label

- Sensative data
- Data retention timelines
- Access restrictions

This is very important for laws such as GDPR, HIPPA, etc.

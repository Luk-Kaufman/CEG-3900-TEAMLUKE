# Threat Intel Notes

Threat intel is information that helps companies understand who might or will attack them, how they will, and how to stop them.

It's used in cybersecurity to make smarter defense decisions instead of just reacting to attacks.

## Why is metadata so important?

Without threat intel, you are just reactiong. With it, you can prepare long before an attack comes your way. It helps

- Block known bad IPs/domains
- Patch the right vulnerabilities
- Recognize phishing campaigns much quicker
- Understand attacker motives and targets

Think of it as a weather forecast.

## Four Main Types

### Strategic Threat Intel

High-level and big picture info for leaders. This focuses on trends, risks, and motivations, such as why ransomware is increasing or which industries are being targeted.

### Tactical Threat Intel

Includes detail about the behavior and techniques of the attacker, such as phishing emails or fake invoice PDFs.

### Operational Threat Intel

Information regarding specific upcoming or active threats.

### Technical Threat Intel

The most detailed type. This includes things your computer can block almost instantaneously:

- Malicious IPs
- File hashes
- Domain names
- Maleware signatures

This is what IT systems and databases rely on to keep things running well.
